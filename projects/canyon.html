    <h1>Canyon Feature Length (Unreleased)</h1>

    <p class="blurb">
      I worked as the Art Department Runner on Canyon, an international film. As the runner I was responsible for sorting all materials for the art department on a tight budget/schedule.
    </p>

    <p class="blurb">
      Alongside my duties as a runner, due to tight budgeting I spent the majority of the job helping with the construction of the set, the greens department, and set decoration.
    </p>

    <p class="blurb">
      Although the film was never released, it was an incredibly valuable job that allowed for my first real experience working in set decoration &amp; building.
